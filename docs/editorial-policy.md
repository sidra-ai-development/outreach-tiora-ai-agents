# Editorial policy

The rules this repository is built and maintained by. The README's
"How agents are selected" section is the short version; this is the full one.

## Scope

Software that pursues a goal over several steps and acts on the world through tools, code execution, or a browser. That covers three genuinely different things, and the categories keep them apart:

- **End-user agents** you point at a task: coding, browsing, research, support, sales, data, workflow automation.
- **Frameworks and platforms** you build agents with, split between libraries and hosted builders.
- **Infrastructure** you run underneath them: sandboxes, browsers, tool connectors, memory, evaluation, and observability.

Mixing those three is what makes most agent lists useless. A reader who wants a coding agent and a reader who wants an orchestration library are not looking for the same thing, and a list that interleaves them serves neither.

## What qualifies

- It takes multiple steps on its own toward a goal, rather than answering one prompt.
- It can call tools, run code, or act on a system outside the chat window.
- It is a real, usable product or project, not a demo repository or a paper.
- There is enough public information to describe it accurately.
- It covers something the entries already in that category do not.

## What does not

- Chatbots and assistants that only answer, however good they are at it.
- Prompt collections, wrapper repositories, and "awesome" lists of other lists.
- Research demos with no maintained implementation.
- Products that use the word agent in marketing but ship a form and a webhook.
- Broken, parked, or login-walled sites with no public information.
- Products that have shut down or been folded into something else.
- Affiliate landing pages, coupon sites, and lead-capture funnels.
- Near-identical clones with no meaningful difference from something already listed.
- Anything whose main activity is clearly illegal, and NSFW-focused products.
- Anything submitted purely as a promotional exercise.

## Descriptions

One sentence, 8 to 25 words, 35 at the absolute maximum, ending in a full stop. Written for
this repository rather than adapted from a vendor's homepage, and rewritten if a neighbouring
entry could swap places with it unnoticed.

Banned outright: superlatives (*best*, *leading*, *revolutionary*, *cutting-edge*,
*game-changing*, *world-class*, *ultimate*, *powerful*, *seamless*, *unleash*), `AI-powered`
as an opening, unverifiable claims about users, funding, or awards, and the em dash inside a
description, which is reserved as the entry separator so the format stays machine-parseable.

## Metadata vocabularies

Closed sets. A term outside them is a defect, not a judgement call.

**Pricing** — at least one, at most two, in this order:
`Free` · `Freemium` · `Paid` · `Open Source` · `Free Trial`

`Open Source` means an OSI-approved licence. Source-available products do not get the label;
the description says "source-available" instead. `Free Trial` never appears alone.

**Platform** — zero to six, in this order:
`Web` · `Windows` · `macOS` · `Linux` · `iOS` · `Android` · `API` · `CLI` ·
`Browser Extension` · `VS Code` · `JetBrains` · `Discord`

Applied only where verified. A wrong label is worse than a missing one.



## Ordering

Alphabetical within a category, ignoring punctuation and a leading "The". Position carries no
meaning and there is no paid placement.

Between categories, the order is editorial, by expected reader interest. That ranks topics,
never products.

## Categories

Minimum 4 entries, 8 is the working target, roughly 15 is the ceiling. A category that cannot
reach 8 strong entries is merged or dropped rather than padded. No subcategories.

The taxonomy is revisited when a category drops below 6 entries, passes 15, or starts
receiving the same submissions as its neighbour.

## Links

The primary link is the resource's own official site: canonical, HTTPS, no tracking
parameters, no affiliate parameters, no shortener, no directory listing, no review page.

TiorAI links are capped: at most 15% of entries carry one, all distinct, at most three per
category, maintainer-placed only. Contributors are asked not to add them.

## Removal

An entry is removed when the product shuts down, the domain is taken over or starts serving
something harmful, the listing turns out to be misleading, or the entry no longer meets the
scope above. Removals are recorded in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md). An entry removed for
a safety reason goes through review again rather than being quietly restored.
